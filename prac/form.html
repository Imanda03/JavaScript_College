      <div class="Grace"><img style="float: right;" src="/photo/Grace_Shelby.jpg" alt="Tommy Selby"></div>
      <p><b>Grace Helen Shelby</b> was an Irish barmaid who took up employment at The Garrison Pub, and
        secretly
        operated as an undercover agent for the Birmingham Police. Her mission involved getting close to Thomas Shelby
        whom she fell in love with. He too returned the sentiment but was heartbroken when he discovered her treachery.
        Having left for New York, Grace returns mid-way through 1922, married to an American businessman, but when she
        reunited with Thomas, it was clear their prior feelings have not dissipated. Their reunion results in Grace's
        pregnancy, which led to the birth of their son Charles. She married Thomas sometime in 1924, which was made
        possible by her first husband's suicide.
        
        She was later murdered from a bullet that was meant for Thomas Shelby. After the incident she appears as a
        hallucination to Thomas, who remains grieving long after her death.<a
