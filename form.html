            Peaky Blinders is a British period crime drama television series created
            by Steven Knight. Set in Birmingham, England, it follows the exploits of
            the Peaky Blinders crime gang in the direct aftermath of the First World
      War. The fictional gang is loosely based on a real urban youth gang of the
      same name who were active in the city from the 1890s to the 1910s. It
      features an ensemble cast led by Cillian Murphy, Helen McCrory and Paul
      Anderson starring as Tommy Shelby, Elizabeth "Polly" Gray, and Arthur
      Shelby, the gang's senior members. Sam Neill, Annabelle Wallis, Iddo
      Goldberg, Charlotte Riley, Tom Hardy, Paddy Considine, Adrien Brody, Aidan
      Gillen, Anya Taylor-Joy, Sam Claflin and Stephen Graham have recurring
      roles. It premiered on 12 September 2013, telecast on BBC Two until the
      fourth series, then moved to BBC One for the fifth and upcoming sixth
      series. The fifth series premiered on BBC One on 25 August 2019 and
      finished on 22 September 2019. Netflix, under a deal with Weinstein
      Company and Endemol, acquired the rights to release the show in the United
      States and around the world. In January 2021, it was announced that series
      six would be the last.
